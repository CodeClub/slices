Description:
    Creates a new slice in app/slices.

    If you want to make a set slice, make sure that the name ends with
    "set" or "Set" (e.g. photo_set or PhotoSet).

    If you want to make a form slice, the name should end with "form".

Example:
    rails generate slice you_tube
    rails generate slice YouTube

    Either of these commands will create:
        app/slices/you_tube/you_tube_slice.rb
        app/slices/you_tube/templates/you_tube.hbs
        app/slices/you_tube/views/show.html.erb

    You will need to restart your rails app after generating a slice
    before it will appear in the admin interface.

    You can define fields on a slice like this:

    rails generate slice slideshow title:string slides:attachments
    rails generate slice countdown text:string ends_at:date_time

Tips:
    Note the shorthand version `rails g slice my_slice`
